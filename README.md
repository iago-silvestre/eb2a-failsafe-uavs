# EB2A-Based Fail-Safe Framework for Autonomous UAVs

This repository hosts the source code, simulation setups, and planning resources for a research project focused on improving the safety and responsiveness of autonomous UAVs using the **Expedited Belief-Desire-Intention Agent Architecture (EB2A)**.

Developed as part of a PhD project at the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC), the framework introduces deterministic fail-safe mechanisms and runtime verification strategies for mission-critical scenarios such as forest firefighting.

##  Project Overview

Traditional BDI agent architectures often suffer from slow response times in real-time UAV operations. This project proposes a faster, more robust alternative—**EB2A**—enhanced with:

- Deterministic fail-safe procedures
- Failure severity perception
- Runtime monitoring
- Optional integration with PX4/Ardupilot failsafes
- User-facing configuration tools

The goal is to improve agent responsiveness and decision-making in safety-critical UAV missions without relying solely on preconfigured flight stack behaviors.
